*A realistic rally car game in unity*
*Andrew and Alex*

wont be finished until every atom, every particle is simulated better than CERN

#Game
we have noticed that in github and unity as a whole their are not many good realistic car games. Most of these games focus on a small aspect of arcade or similar to enhance our ape and monley filled brains. We have realised this gives people bad expecations and doesnt make them enjoy *_real racing.

Our solution to this is by making a game with realistic as possible car racing while also making it fun and enhancing for all players.
